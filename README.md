Age-Period-Cohort analysis identifies patterns in cancer incidence or mortality rates from population-based Count (numerator) and Population (denominator) data. Often the data come from a Cancer Registry (e.g., SEER) in the form of a table showing the numbers of cancer cases or cancer deaths (counts) and corresponding person-years at risk (population) for particular age groups and calendar time periods. This toolset provides a comprehensive solution to age-period-cohort analysis for cancer endpoints in defined populations and time periods.
